# Pioneer Hockey iPhone App

This is an iPhone app I developed in 2008 that displayed the most recent Hill-Murray hockey score from [hmpioneers.net](https://hmpioneers.net/hockey/) as well as the next upcoming game.

It was ultimately rejected because it didn't provide enough functionality to justify a full app.
